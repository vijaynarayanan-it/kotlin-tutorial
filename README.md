# Learn Kotlin

![alt text](https://github.com/vijaynarayanan-it/kotlin-tutorial/blob/main/Kotlin-logo.png)

It's really easy to start using Kotlin, especially if you're a Java developer. You can use all the existing Java frameworks and libraries from Kotlin. You can even mix Kotlin and Java code in one project. Kotlin is a JVM language, so you can easily call Java code from Kotlin, but that also works in the other direction.

Kotlin is designed in a way so that using its all features from Java was straightforward. That means, that you can make the transition from Java to Kotlin very slow by adding new features to your existing Java application written in Kotlin.
